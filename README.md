# Handwritten Digit Recognition Project

This repository contains the code and resources for a Handwritten Digit Recognition project. The primary goal of this project is to create a machine learning model capable of accurately recognizing handwritten digits from images.

## Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a fundamental problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. This project focuses on building a system that can identify and classify handwritten digits accurately. Such models find application in various domains, including optical character recognition, digitizing historical documents, and automation in banking for reading checks.

## Features

- **Digit Recognition**: The AI model accurately recognizes handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9.
- **Multi-Class Classification**: The system can classify digits into ten different classes, one for each digit.
- **High Accuracy**: The model achieves high accuracy in identifying handwritten digits from images.

## Requirements

To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (based on the implementation)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Other necessary libraries specified in the `requirements.txt` file

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Prepare the Dataset**

    Obtain a dataset of handwritten digits, such as MNIST or a custom dataset. Ensure proper preprocessing and splitting into training and test sets.

4. **Training the Model**

    Use the provided scripts to train the AI model on the prepared dataset.

    ```bash
    python train.py --dataset <path_to_dataset>
    ```

5. **Testing and Evaluation**

    Evaluate the trained model's performance on test data or individual images.

    ```bash
    python test.py --model <path_to_trained_model> --image <path_to_test_image>
    ```

6. **Integration**

    Integrate the trained model into your application or use the provided inference scripts for recognizing handwritten digits in real-time.
